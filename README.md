# Game Of Life

This project was intended to re-aquaint me with Java, and to practice multithreading.
It allows users to run multiple instances of Conway's Game of Life based on custom parameters, and to import and export these generated boards.

# Logging System

The logging system will not function correctly on Mac OS based systems. The rest of the program should run correctly. 

## Features

- Supported by any platform that can run Java
- Set custom parameters and create boards that play out the game of life, with up to twenty simultaneous simulations possible. 
- Users can pause their simulations, click to create or kill cells, and then resume to watch the patterns play out. 
- Users can save interesting patterns and boards, and import them to be resumed later.
